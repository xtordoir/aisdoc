	<h2>About Alma in Silico APIs</h2>
	</header>
	<section>
		<p>This set of APIs and tools is developed by the <a href="http://www.alma-in-silico.com">alma in Silico</a> bioinformatics team.</p>
		<p>With a cloudy approach, we aim to provide a platform to manage data storage, actions and annotations on these data, laboratory services and data processing services.</p>
		<p>Providers can plug their resources into the system and expose their services to granted users. A support for resources usage logging for billing purposes is also offered.</p>
		<p>
			Each API provided by AIS is a web-based service, any operation is accessible through HTTP requests via a REST interface. The HTTP requests are wrapped in Command Line tools, allowing an easy programmatic access to the service stack.
		</p>
	<p>
		There are 4 categories in the service stack:
		<ul>
			<li>Services</li>
			<li>Storage</li>
			<li>Application</li>
			<li>Access and Billing</li>
